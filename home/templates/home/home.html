    <p class="container my-4 col-9">This is the Path of Manjunath. Its not easy to walk on Path Of Manjunath, well it's
        not that hard either. But its full of hardship and agony and pain and suffering and torment. But there are some
        moments which he Finds Beautiful and Mesmorising and Funny and Great and Nice that he can't help but capture, in
        whatever way he can. And this Website is dedicated to those captured moments. Hope You will enjoy it as much as
        we have while making it.
